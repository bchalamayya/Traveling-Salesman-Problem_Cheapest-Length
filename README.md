# Traveling-Salesman-Problem---Cheapest-Length

This is a c++ implementation of the Cheapest Link solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem. It was written as part of a project for a class in computer Algorithms. The goal was to come up with the best in class algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. (For more info on the Traveling Salesman Problem, see the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem.)

Algorithm: Cheapest Link Algorithm
 
Synopsis:
Cheapest Link is an algorithm which attempts to find the shortest by sequentially adding the shortest edges in the graph. The rationale is that by taking the shortest graph edges possible, then we get a reasonably short distance every time. 
 
Discussion:
I decided to try this algorithm after researching Google Maps. Google Maps actually uses numerous algorithms in parallel to find the best path to a destination. However "Cheapest Arc", a derivative of Cheapest Link was the first algorithm mentioned in Google's documentation. Google's documentation turned out to not be that helpful in writing the code, other than providing inspiration. Online lecture videos about the Cheapest Link algorithm provided clearer explanations on how to implement it. In particular the online video "Cheapest Link Algorithm" by MSLT Mathematics was very helpful in explaining the algorithm.
